    "After fitting three univariate linear regression models, we observed the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Median Income**: highest correlation with the median home value.  The MSE and MAE figures it generated were the lowest.  The rising trend is well-captured by the regression line.\n",
    "- **Population**: very poor linear correlation.  The fitted line does not adequately depict the data, and the scatter plot is widely scattered.\n",
    "- **Number of Households**: is still far lower than median income, but it has a little better trend than the population.\n",
    " **Final Insight**:\n",
    "The model using **median income** as the most trustworthy factor for estimating home prices is the separate variable.  It offers lowest errors in forecasting and a distinct trend.  As a result, we advise using it as the main variable in basic linear models."
